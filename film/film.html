                </div>
                The praise that Brooklyn Nine-Nine has received over its positive portrayal of under- and misrepresented groups explored throughout this paper is something to be applauded. The diversity of its cast through both ethnically and by sexuality standards makes an important statement to its audiences that they are seen, their voices are heard, and their stories will be told.

                </div>
                Like so many other shows and films, WandaVision was most effective when it was the most personal. You didn't really have to follow the ins and outs of White Vision and know the long story of Agatha Harkness or even understand the red and purple magic and whatnot — to get the emotional gist. Wanda, tormented by grief at the death of her husband, created a fantasy in which they had a happy life together and raised children in the kind of place she dreamed of living as a child. But like most lies, it was destined to fall apart, because it was fiction and her her grief was real. So this finale was most effective when that was the focus: her farewells to the fantasy children, her farewell to the fantasy Vision, her acceptance of her responsibility for the damage she'd done and her resignation to the reality of her loss.

                    <h2>PARASITE</h2>
                </div>
                The director’s always shown an interest in class conflict. The train in Snowpiercer is just one big metaphor for capitalism, after all. But Parasite might be his most intricate examination of the topic so far. The “parasite” of the title applies to every character in this film; the rich leech off the poor, who in turn survive by attaching themselves to the underbelly of the ruling class.

                    <h2>SHUTTER ISLAND</h2>
                </div>
                This one's a gritty drama, with Scorsese creating some marvellous set pieces where the past intervenes with the present and Leonardo creates a compelling picture of brooding disarray. The film however does get bogged down a bit by its gloomy overtones and its meandering flashbacks which tend to distract. But the sledgehammer climax more than makes up for these minor flaws.
