                <p><sup>1</sup>Childhood is the most fun and memorable time in anyone’s life. <sup>2</sup>Well, not mine; I’ve spent the better part of my childhood in front of different screens.<sup>3</sup>This is because my parents are business-oriented. <sup>4</sup>I’ll be left alone in the house in the morning with food prepared for the whole day and the tv loaded with my favorite shows. <sup>5</sup>Then, they’ll be home when it is almost time to sleep. <sup>6</sup>As I grew older, I got bored of watching tv, so I asked for the Playstation 2; my first ever console.</p>

                <p><sup>7</sup>I grew fond of the <abbr title="Playstation 2"><b>PS2</b></abbr> not just because it was fun to play, but because I was intrigued by how video games are made: how am I able to control this character, how were the storylines written, how were the graphics made, etc. <sup>8</sup>This as you can say was my “gateway drug” into gaming. <sup>9</sup>I wanted every console, wanted to beat every game, and figure out every mechanic of various games. <sup>10</sup>And my parents would gladly buy me anything just to keep me occupied at home.<sup>11</sup>Then, they migrated to the United Arab Emirates and I was left at the care of my grandparents. <sup>12</sup>They were more hands on when they took care of me, but I was too adrift already to really form a connection with them. <sup>13</sup>This was also the time I got my first computer.</p>

                <p><sup>1</sup>This period in my life was where the problems arose. <sup>2</sup>Being someone that pretty much stayed inside the house his whole life. <sup>3</sup>Imagine being thrown into a vastly different country with a vastly different culture and types of people, I was overwhelmed to say the least. <sup>4</sup>And my first instinct was to isolate myself from the world. <sup>5</sup>I didn’t want to socialize with anyone at school or anywhere. <sup>6</sup>And it didn’t help that I also didn’t know how to. <sup>7</sup>So I became a nobody; I’m just someone who’s always in the corner playing video games. <sup>8</sup>People just brush me off, and I just come off to people as a very chill guy. </p>

                <p><sup>9</sup>But, people started wondering, because I always get good scores and always manage to get high honors while always slacking off. <sup>10</sup>So people started noticing me; people wondered how this chill guy was doing good at school. <sup>11</sup>Does he actually know what he’s doing? <sup>12</sup>So people started approaching me and started befriending me. <sup>13</sup>The problem is, I didn’t know how to interact with people; sure I was in a Filipino school, but it was still different. <sup>14</sup>Their colloquial language, mannerism, and overall vibe. <sup>15</sup>So throughout my teenage years, a lot of people came in and went away in my life. <sup>16</sup>A lot didn’t like that I was too straightforward with my words and personality. <sup>17</sup>I didn’t know how to sugarcoat my words and didn’t really know how to empathize with people.  <sup>18</sup>I also tried dipping my toes into relationships and a lot of them didn’t go well; except for one. <sup>19</sup>Well, we didn’t actually end up together romantically. <sup>20</sup>But, I think we’re in a much better state than a romantic relationship. She became almost like a twin sister to me. <sup>21</sup>She helped me better myself in several aspects. <sup>22</sup>She introduced me to hobbies and things that I now hold near and dear to my heart, like: anime, comics, different types of music, and art. <sup>23</sup>But most importantly she taught me empathy. <sup>24</sup>She helped me how to properly process my thoughts and articulate them in a manner that I won’t hurt anyone. <sup>25</sup>It took me a long time to learn, I hurt her a couple times with my words. <sup>26</sup>But, she didn’t falter and continued to help me develop my emotional quotient.</p>

                <p><sup>1</sup>My stay in the <abbr title="Playstation 2"><b>UAE</b></abbr> was great. <sup>2</sup>I got to develop my graphics design skills, I got to join photography and video production competitions, submit a film to a film festival, and even get featured in the news a couple of times. <sup>3</sup>But, after graduating, my parents wanted me to continue my education in the Philippines. <sup>4</sup>So I took the <abbr title="University of Santo Tomas Entrance Test"> <b>USTET</b></abbr> and <abbr title="University of the East College Entrance zest"><b>UE-CET</b></abbr> and passed them both. <sup>5</sup>At first I chose UST; I already enrolled and we were about to pay the tuition. <sup>6</sup>But, UE emailed me and notified me that I was eligible for the <abbr title="UE Tan Yan Kee Foundation Inc."><b>UE-TYKFI</b></abbr> Scholarship. <sup>7</sup>So I took the test for the scholarship, passed, and got interviewed. Fortunately, I was chosen to be a scholar, so I Am now taking up Computer Science in <abbr title="University of the East"><b>UE</b></abbr>. <sup>8</sup>At first I thought it was going to be another hard transition period. <sup>9</sup>But this time, I was more emotionally adept, so I was able to adapt more easily. <sup>10</sup>I was able to easily make friends now.</p>

                <p><sup>11</sup>I was also able to get a loving girlfriend that’s currently taking up Psychology. <sup>12</sup>So she currently can further help me develop my emotional capabilities and help me with my issues. <sup>13</sup>My college years were going great; until COVID happened. <sup>14</sup>But, with the quarantine, I was able to focus on developing myself. <sup>15</sup>I was able to freelance as a Graphics Designer. <sup>16</sup>But, more importantly, I was able to develop myself physically. <sup>17</sup>The quarantine allowed me to commit myself to becoming more healthy and fit. <sup>18</sup>I was able to get my weight down from 92 kg to 78 kg and my body fat percentage to 17%. <sup>19</sup>And now, I can finally call myself mentally, emotionally, and physically fit. <sup>20</sup>But, I still like that people view me as a chill guy that probably doesn’t know what he’s doing. <sup>21</sup>But in reality, I actually know what I’m doing.</p>
