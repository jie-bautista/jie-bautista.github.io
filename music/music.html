                </div>
                When put into the context of idol music, Wind Flower barely feels like a title track at all. However, that shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. One of the driving forces behind Mamamoo’s rise to the top has been their ability to skirt the line between idol pop and a more indie-focused sensibility. Wind Flower falls closer to the latter, but bolsters its gentle groove with a breezy sing-along hook. Much of the group’s work this year has felt quite trendy. In contrast, Flower boasts a timeless appeal.

                </div>
                GO HARD is a bass and drum-heavy track that features a fun melody by what sounds like a clarinet or saxophone. This serves as the build up to the chorus, which is a continuation of those same instruments. This song is a power anthem that should give anyone the confidence to be strong. This song's message is powerful and for many people it’s most definitely needed.

                Propelled by an arena-ready guitar riff, Nobody’s verses offer an engaging, sing-talk structure that pulls in just enough melody to work. The pre-chorus is even stronger, as backing vocals emerge to support a lower-toned delivery that draws on the members’ personality. This takes me right back to the fists-in-the-air sing-along choruses of the One Direction era of early 2010’s pop music.

                </div>
                It just might be the most breathtaking song she has ever made. Exile encapsulates all of the mature beauty that makes Folklore a success. The melody is slow, tragic and exquisite. Their voices are strong and harmonious with each other and the piano. Exile reflects on a toxic past relationship, as Swift and Vernon sing “I think I’ve seen this film before / So I’m leaving out the side door.” Exile is an evolution from the tone of Swift’s former breakup songs. Like “I Knew You Were Trouble,” “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” and “Bad Blood,” Exile communicates the message of getting over past heartbreak, but from a different perspective, one that sprouted from Swift’s genuine introspection and newfound happiness.

                The verses describe what seems like a troubled time in the singer’s past, with lyrics about throwing punches and waking up with no memory of what happened the night before. Even though these experiences might not have been great, Hemmings is still grateful for how they shaped him into the person he is today: “Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me.”
                <br>
                “Old Me carries a youthful spirit and follows the narrative of a young person’s life growing up, for better or for worse,” Hemmings said in a statement about the song. “Every decision we made, whether right or wrong, has led us to the men we are proud to be today. We were thrown into the public eye at a young age and gratefully had each other at a confusing time. Sometimes it’s important we look back in order to appreciate the journey we’ve been on together.”

                He sent us into a state of shock with his eponymous debut mixtape. He opened up about his innermost struggles with depression, anxiety, success, failure and poverty, and we simply hadn’t seen any K-pop star bare their soul at this level before. K-pop has always been about cultivating a controversy free, positive image of perfection, but then rose this anarchist with nothing to lose, the underdog who shattered stereotypes with his realistically foul mouth and no-nonsense attitude.

                Eminem’s verse was fantastic as always, great word play, great flow, fun to listen to Logic’s verse was okay, nothing I haven’t heard before. Literally. For the past year or so, 90% of Logic’s music has left me wanting so much more. This was a step up from some of his recent stuff, but still not up to my expectations, especially when you’re collaborating with Eminem, the undisputed best in the business.

                The lyrics of the song are both hilarious and impressive. Juice WRLD’s verse as a chorus really hits hard and makes you feel the song. Eminem’s rap verses were very fast, some of the time you couldn’t process what he was saying, but when you could, you can really appreciate the work that’s going into the lyrics. However, Eminem knew that in order to get back in the mainstream, he had to top the song that was looming over him.
                <br>
                Rap God has always been credited for being one of the fastest rap songs ever made. The fastest verse in Godzilla is by far faster and pushes the limits of human language.
